## My process

-Before write any code, i organized my vscode, and put on some music to get chill

- I started by setting everything rigth in the HTML file, once everything it's in the right place, i start the CSS work.

- In this case i used the mobile design first, wich i must admit i liked it, it was very comfortable, and faster

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
### What I learned

- I earned a better comprehension of the media querys, to make a responsive website, talking bout the min and max width properties specifically.
### Continued development

- I wanna keep getting better at making responsive things in a website (wether it's a navbar, or an specific item, etc)
- As well as slowly learn JS by inserting functions and interactivity in my websites.
